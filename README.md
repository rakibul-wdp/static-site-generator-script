- A Javascript script was coded to transform the template into dynamic HTML pages.
- The UI of the template was fashioned in Figma and built with Bootstrap.
- A NodeJS + Express app was created to generate HTML pages using a template designed with EJS.
- To enhance the functionality of the app, modifications were made to the views/template.ejs file to allow for the inclusion of Bootstrap, static images, and static CSS files in the generated HTML pages.
- The final result is a beautiful and powerful app that seamlessly combines the power of NodeJS and Express with the beauty of Bootstrap and Figma to create dynamic, visually stunning HTML pages.
